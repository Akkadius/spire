## [3.12.3] 2/7/2024

* **Spire Admin** Fix issue where the server update page would not load because it was not rejecting errors from https://spire.akkadius.com properly. The error occurred because the hosted site is now **https** (SSL) and we hadn't updated our fetch logic to handle this. This is now fixed and the server update page will load properly again.

## [3.12.2] 2/4/2024

* **Database** Implement log database connection resolving. This allows operators to utilize the "QS" database connection type for logs, particularly sinking player event logs to an external database or server. When a QS connection is specified in the `eqemu_config.json` - player event logs will automatically route to that connection. This is useful for operators who want to sink logs to an external database or server for auditing purposes. The database configuration gets synchronized and injected during Spire bootup and also during Spire Admin configuration saving.
* **Player Event Log Viewer** Player event log request is split from character data bulk loading two split the queries on separate connections
* **Spire Admin** When making configuration changes in the configuration editor UI - the database connection resolver will flush along with any cached user connections. The `eqemu_config.json` will also be re-injected into the `spire_server_database_connections` table
* **Database Resolver** Added a connection type of `eqemu_logs` of which `player_event_logs` and `player_event_log_settings` both route to currently.
* **Configuration Sync** Ensure we also empty fields when they are removed from the `eqemu_config.json` when saving the configuration in Spire Admin

## [3.11.3] 1/29/2024

### [Spire Admin] Dashboard

Similar to the dashboard in [Occulus](https://github.com/Akkadius/Occulus), but ported for modernization, quality of life changes, and the high-level server information is always available at the top of every admin page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229333545-e8c6132c-68f7-4971-8d7c-0e00eda67eb6.png)

### [Spire Admin] Server Pre-Flight Checks

Before you launch your server, you are required to run basic pre-flight checks, this will ensure that your processes don't have any issues and you are made aware of them before all of your processes are launched in the background

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229333233-b0fc22b1-0df0-467b-8b13-53621c382306.png)

Critical bug fixes have also been made to the HRM

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334070-96250391-8cc4-4c9f-b00c-e267d0f96969.png)

### [Spire Admin] Server Reloading

You can trigger server reloads directly through Spire. Reloads are triggered globally and reload data from the database into the server memory state.

Many tools already utilize this when editing related data.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229336522-158c268e-48bb-4180-8ca3-e53a9bc4e446.png)

### [Spire Admin] Server Rules

List, search, edit your server rules in real time. Spire will reload rules directly on your server immediately so you do not need to manually reload them in game. Super handy!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334145-4536565e-50b2-4b17-bc7a-7f0bf485bd92.png)

### [Spire Admin] Server Database Backup

Ever just want to take a quick manual database backup? Spire admin could not make this any easier by tapping into the native eqemu server utility that wraps around `mysqldump`. You can select specific types of tables to dump, dump everything and compress it with an immediate download

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334188-57e515d1-efee-4572-9b6d-620b4d1cbb87.png)


### [Spire Admin] Server File Log Viewer

Completely overhauled and ported from Occulus. Spire file log viewer is highly performant, streams realtime and only streams changes since the last file write.

Emulates console coloring, filters by log type, search filters, file deletion, bulk file deletion and more!

<video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334302-064df32f-9f27-405a-a6f0-c5623ab35400.mp4" data-canonical-src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334302-064df32f-9f27-405a-a6f0-c5623ab35400.mp4" controls="controls" muted="muted" class="d-block rounded-bottom-2 border-top width-fit" style="max-height:640px; min-height: 200px"></video>

### [Spire Admin] Discord Logging Webhooks

Manage your Discord logging webhooks directly through Spire.

### [Spire Admin] Manage Server Logging Settings

Manage your logging settings directly in Spire admin. Anytime changes are made your logging settings are reloaded real-time in the server without having to reboot or type commands in game!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334469-85521c13-5435-4419-b9c2-2102949d7043.png)

### [Spire Admin] Player Event Log Explorer

Accompanied by a massive new feature in the EverQuest Emulator server ([see Player Event Logging](https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/pull/2833)) we are brought a powerful new explorer for rich auditing tools.

#### Rich Data Viewing

Spire translates event data into viewable NPC, Item, Spell etc. cards to have contextual insight into the events and what they contain.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/216812922-547efee0-4a84-4b1d-8637-1a2d13283cba.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/216810318-32e0e8f3-1392-497e-a14b-55f6585e7edd.png)

#### Event Raw

Any event you can see the richly formatted event or you can inspect the raw event data

![event-raw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/216810779-b14bbb99-7492-497e-afdf-407843ab1275.gif)

#### Flexible Filtering

You can filter by event type, zone_id, character_id which are top level filters always available and indexed regardless of event type

![event-filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/216810442-62040911-f17c-4b41-b032-ec00a440c49d.gif)

#### Advanced Event Data Filtering

You can filter by JSON event data

![event-data-filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/216810590-9802cfb5-a619-4e08-ab0e-342376e4044b.gif)

You can even filter by deeply nested data. For example if you're trying to search for a certain item that was traded by doing a nested wildcard search

![event-deep-filter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/216810644-dea5d9b6-3a8c-4936-afaf-efae03fb1fe5.gif)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334536-f035ccd4-45ae-48e0-b5f7-e5b57a7b80e0.png)

### [Spire Admin] Player Event Log Settings

Once again you're able to edit your player event log settings within spire admin and changes are real-time reloaded in game without having to issue commands!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334708-ab18f1d2-d9bb-49c8-8689-747bce0c2453.png)

### [Spire Admin] Server Update

Spire admin now has a rich interface where you can download new server releases, or build your own (Linux only)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334953-b945783c-9e6a-4356-90d8-3a53d0dc7f21.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334987-c7ac5374-a4ca-436e-b52f-9d8b7edf471f.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334994-e5ca8f0f-6f65-442d-90f2-691438792c30.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334970-cae8036a-5d15-44ce-87f5-67bcc9fddb09.png)

### [Spire Admin] Permissions

If you'd like to limit access of other users to your server and especially sensitive areas. There are permissions that cover access to various resources within the admin section of Spire in your local installation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229336838-8e7a73d7-8e05-4737-a89f-1a61e0cae0e1.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229336858-d0becf18-f67f-45aa-b543-1db54685e774.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229336867-70706d23-d286-4ada-a04a-039f0a6903fe.png)

### Spire Setup

Spire when ran locally will now redirect users to a one-time initial setup where users can choose whether they want their install to be guarded by authentication or not.

This bootstraps Spire for local installations.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229335122-9ee573db-93e4-48b5-8c8a-b836c0bd03cf.png)

### Local Users

Spire now has the ability during initial install to be configured with local users and authentication!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229334852-bc03242f-fe94-41f2-9a97-3ab866cdcf90.png)

### Navigation Search

Want to quickly and fluidly navigate your way around Spire? There's now a kbar in Spire similar to Discord, Slack, Github etc.

Navigation search can be activated by using Ctrl + K, Ctrl + / or clicking "Search" in the navigation menu

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229332345-76c89678-ccc5-4850-b223-39dd0af5f712.png)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

My pressing the **Control** key, you can now see a modal that will show you Spire keyboard shortcuts

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3319450/229333312-8fd5fd05-6fa2-42bc-8fc5-27aef60b1f6f.png)

### Permissions

With users, come permissions. You are now able to manage permissions with both read and write for every resource available through Spire. You can also use **ALL** to grant users to all read or write.

* Fields `npc_id` and `npc_goal_id` combine into `npc_match_list` which can contain a single NPC or a list of NPC's that are pipe delimited `|` Example (4007|4009|4013|4024|4036|4043|4078|4080) and can also contain NPC names as partials (orc|gnoll|bear)
* Instead of `goalmethod` and `rewardmethod` displayed as dropdowns. It simply is a checkbox that displays **Quest Controlled**
* Performance and caching updates
* Resolved issues with tasks saving inconsistently
* Reward window should now display multiple items
* Task rewards now support multiple items inline
* Tasks now save automatically when a field is modified and activity actions are invoked
* Tasks now set proper defaults for `req_activity_id` (-1)

### NPC Match List Support

Match lists are **| pipe separated lists** containing NPC ID(s) or partial (wildcard) NPC names. This is very useful especially when trying to filter activity updates by name.

NPC match lists are available with the following activity types

* Deliver
* Kill
* Speak with
* Give

Fields `npc_id` and `npc_goal_id` have combined

### Exploration Box Changes

Exploration used to be managed by the **proximities** table. Part of the recent waves of simplification this is now managed on the **task_activities** table to simplify. As a result explore boxes are now visible within the activity pane instead of breaking out as their own sub-editor when editing an explore activity type.

### Multiple Item Reward(s)

Not only are multiple rewards now possible through the **Reward Item ID(s)** field (**separated by |**) you can also see them render in the **Task Preview Window**

### Item Editor v1 Launch!

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iQvm9pH8420/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQvm9pH8420)

* Initial set of item search filters, more to be added later down the road
* Search for items by either **table** or **card** formats, **table** is default
* Item card preview on table item row hover
* All item fields are supported out of the box with a detailed editor
* Class bitmask selector
* Race bitmask selector
* Deity bitmask selector
* Slot bitmask selector

#### Hover Selector / Preview Tools

* Item editor comes bundled with many hover selector and preview tools to make development feedback loop the tightest
  and best experience it can possibly be. Examples of these include:
* Item free ID selector (hover over "id")
* Item model selector (hover over "idfile")
* Item icon selector (hover over "icon")
* Item color selector (hover over "color")
* Item material previewer (hover over "material", arrow selector) (cloth, chain, plate, robe etc.)
* Item augment type selector (hover over "augtype")
* Item effects selector (hover over any effect "spell id" field)

#### Item Editor Sane Defaults

* The item editor does a lot in the way of setting sane defaults for the user. There are a lot of fields that need to be
  set when other fields are set so there are triggers that are setup to make this more intuitive.
* When **worneffect** is set to a non-zero value, **worntype** is set to 2
* When **clickeffect** is set to a non-zero value, **clicktype** is set to 5, recast delay set to 12000, maxcharges -1
  and casttime to 3000
* When **scrolleffect** is set to a non-zero value, **scrolltype** is automatically set to 7
* When **bardeffect** is set to a non-zero value, **bardeffecttype** is set to 8
* When **augslot_1_type** is set to a non-zero value, **augslot_1_visible** is set to 1
* When **augslot_2_type** is set to a non-zero value, **augslot_2_visible** is set to 1
* When **augslot_3_type** is set to a non-zero value, **augslot_3_visible** is set to 1
* When **augslot_4_type** is set to a non-zero value, **augslot_4_visible** is set to 1
* When **augslot_5_type** is set to a non-zero value, **augslot_5_visible** is set to 1

### Quest API Explorer

* Added a **Refresh** button for local and desktop builds for anyone who wants to refresh their Quest definitions
  manually. Production and hosted version of Spire receives webhooks when new commits are made to EQEmu/Server and local
  installations won't receive this and require a manual update.

### General Fixes

* (Kinglykrab reported) Dark Elf short name is now DEF, Wood Elf short name is now ELF, High Elf short name is now HIE,
  Halfling short name is now HFL
* (Kinglykrab reported) Powersource icon was using Charm icon and is now the proper icon
* Scrollbar should be twice the size in width now
* (Trust reported) Expansion bitmask calculator now reports 0 (Classic) correctly
* Added an **Only** button to classes in the items search view so that search results can filter on items that are only
  equipped by selected class.

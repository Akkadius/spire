# packr for packing web assets into binary
#go install github.com/gobuffalo/packr/packr

# This step originally packed static assets in the binary
# as of this writing it's gotten up to roughly 500-600MB uncompressed
#
# 2/23/2022 we are separating the assets from the binary and having them
# automatically downloaded separately on the initialization of the application
#
# Copy local asset images (This step is part of install now)
# make build-assets
# make strip-extra-assets
